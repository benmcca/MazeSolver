# MazeSolver
Maze Project from Coding Lesson

This is a project I worked on from an online coding lesson.
From the project I learned how to use the curses module and queues. 

The curses module was really helpful as it let me modify the terminal and keep refreshing the maze rather than having to repeatedly print the maze progress. The curses module also let me incorporate color into the terminal which I have never done before. 

Using queues enabled me to create a method that would solve the maze. The queue follows a first in first out structure. By inputting the open spots for the path to take into the queue, it would check all these spots for a way to the maze ending.

To run this file, pip install windows-curses
The program is flexible to whatever maze is set at the beginning. So feel free to modify it however you would like!
